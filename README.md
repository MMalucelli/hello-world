# hello-world
My personal project library. Just getting started.

I'm a 23 year young brazilian and quite familiar with technology since I spent most of my teenage years on my computer. I love the immediate feedback and ability to get creative that programming offers, so I decided to change my career path from financial advisoring to coding.

Right now it all feels overwhelming since there's so many paths available and a lot to learn, and it's not like it's easy to learn how to code. Add that to the fact that I'm working full time since I have to pay my own bills. Shit. Front end, back end, what framework should I use... HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Angular, Vue, React, Node.js, Svelte, APIs, cloud services, THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON.

Resilience. I know that eventually I'll get good at it and fulfill my expectations with myself.
